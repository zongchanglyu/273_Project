SVHN is a real-world image data set for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms which incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). 
The data format we choose is format 2. We print out the shape of training data X which is a 4-D matrix (32, 32, 3, 73257), that means all digits have been resized to a fixed resolution of 32-by-32 pixels. 3 is the height means they are color picture, and 73257 is the number of training data. y is the corresponding label.
